    <abstract>
    
<t>The profile shall allow a RP to access ID services of multiple MNOs (e.g. in a market)
 while not requiring this RP to (manually) register with all of them. The RP shall 
 register to a certain MNO or another entity MNOs delegated this task to once and obtain
  the right to access the desired MNO's ID services. To enable this autonomy of relying 
  parties and OpenID Providers (the MNO's) dynamic client registration must be possible.
    It is however necessary to verify the level of trustworthiness (and potentially 
    entitlement) of an RP and enable the OP to approve or block RP's accordingly. Thus 
    it will be necessary to establish some measures of control to verify the legitimacy 
    of the RP. </t>
<t>For the Mobile Profile we propose to extend [4] with Software Statements as 
specified in [5]. </t>
<t>It is beyond the scope of the Mobile Profile how the RP will obtain original 
legitimation. It is assumed that some trustworthy party validates the RP and issues 
the software statement to the RP.</t>
<t>It is also beyond the scope of the Mobile Profile how an OP validates the 
software statement.</t>
<t>It could be in scope to profile the use of software statements to 
(a) certain signature algorithm(s) and meta data.</t>

      <t>OpenID Connect Mobile Registration Profile 1.0 is a profile of the 
      <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Registration 1.0</xref> specification
      that allows a Client to dynamically register with multiple MNO based on information
      asserted by a primary MNO that the client has a relationship with.

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

          This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
          "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
          "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client Secret",
          "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server", and
          "Token Endpoint" defined by <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>.
          This specification also defines the following terms: 
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Token Agent (TA)">
               A native application that obtains access tokens on behalf of other native applications - thereby enabling a Single SignOn
               experience for Native Application end users because the End-Users need only explicitly authenticate the <spanx style="emph">TA</spanx> once per Authorization Server.
            </t>
            <t hangText="AppInfo Endpoint">
                A protected resource that the <spanx style="emph">TA</spanx> can call (using its primary access token) to obtain metadata corresponding to a set of 
                applications - both web &amp; native. The <spanx style="emph">TA</spanx> uses the application metadata in order to obtain secondary access tokens for those 
                applications.
            </t>
             <t hangText="Primary Token">
              An OAuth token (access, refresh, and id_token) obtained by the <spanx style="emph">TA</spanx> for its own uses.

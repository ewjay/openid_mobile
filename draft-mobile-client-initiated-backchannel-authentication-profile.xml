        This specification is profile of the OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel

          Note: While the structure of a <spanx style="verb">login_hint</spanx> is undefined, in a 
          mobile context a login_hint is likely to contain a MSISDN. 
        </t>
        <t>
          Note: An ecosystem can protect the pricacy of a user's MSISDN and other personally identifiable
          information through the use of a discovery service. The discovery service can return an 
          encrypted <spanx style="verb">login_hint_token</spanx> for use in a CIBA flow.

    </section>

    <section anchor="security_considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
       While this profile suports CIBA push mode, implementers should only implement that mode if 
       the constraints of an environment require it, e.g. high latency environments. Poll and Ping modes 
       are to be preferred as the method of token delivery in those modes is the same as other OAuth 2 
       based flows, and therefore more likely to have had appropriate security review. 
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="privacy_considerations" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>
        Using MODRNA Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication it is possible for the Client
        to authenticate a user without knowing e.g. the MSISDN of the user.
        Users might be reluctant to provide their MSISDN to Clients because they fear
        misuse through automated calls or their number being leaked.
        The login hint token can be encrypted in order to protect the user's MSISDN from 
        being revealed to the Client unintentionally.
      </t>

      <t>
        The section <xref target="SimAppletExample" format="title"/> shows an example to illustrate
        the usage of CIBA specification to authenticate a user with a SIM Applet Authenticator.

    <section anchor="SimAppletExample" title="Example Flow">
      <t>
        This is a non-normative example where a challenge authentication is launched by the OP to an applet that is running in the
        end-user device's SIM. Such applet implements an authenticator that validates a Pin Code entered by the end-user.
      </t>
      <t>
        This authenticator would be implemented through the so-called MSSP (Mobile Signature Subscriber Provider) Server.
        When the Backchannel Authentication Endpoint receives the request to authenticate the user and once it knows the user's MSISDN, it makes a call
        to the MSSP Server which builds a binary Class 2 SMS that is sent to the SIM card of the user where the applet is located.
      </t>

      <t>
        This Class 2 SMS is not really sent directly from the MSSP but through the OTA (Over the air) platform which in turn signs 
        and encrypts the message using a pair of keys (kyc, kyd) unique per each SIM Card.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        Once the message reaches the SIM Card, it is decrypted by the CardManager and the signature is verified (thanks to the same pair of keys: kyc, kyd).
        If everything is ok, the CardManager gives the message to the applet that checks the signature (the another one made by the MSSP) and displays the challenge
        through a popup using the mobile phone native interface) and the user is prompted to enter a Pin Code that is validated locally.
        If the Pin Code is correct, the applet builds an OK response and signs it with the same key used by the MSSP to sign the request, this 
        response is sent as a Class 3 message to the MSSP that checks the signature, and builds the id_token and the access_token to be returned to the Client.

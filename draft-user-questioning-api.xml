      <t>This specification defines a specific endpoint used by a Client (i.e. Service Provider)
      in order to question a End-User and get his Statement (i.e. his answer).</t>
      <t>This endpoint is specified as an OAuth 2.0-protected Resource Server accessible with an Access Token.</t>
      <t>The way the Access Token has been obtained by the Client is out of scope of this specification.</t>
	  <t>Whether the End-User is currently using the Client or not is also out of scope of this specification.</t>
      <t>The User Questioning API is an asynchronous API. There are 3 main ways to get the End-User's Statement: the first one requires some polling of the API, the second requires the Client to expose a callback endpoint and the third one requires a user interaction on the Client.</t>
	  <section anchor="rnc" title="Requirements Notation and Conventions">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        <t>Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
        to be taken literally. When using these values in protocol messages, the
        quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>
          This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Resource Server", and "Client" defined by <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>.
          This specification also defines the following terms: 
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Questioned User">
               <spanx style="strong"></spanx> End-User receiving the question and requested to give his Statement.

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>The User Questioning protocol, in abstract, follows the following steps.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="format %d.">
			<t>The Client sends a User Questioning Request to the OpenID Provider (OP).</t>
			<t>The OP interacts with the Questioned User and obtains his Statement.</t>
			<t>The OP responds to the Client with a User Questioning Response.</t>
        </list>

    <section title="Example of use cases involving the User Questioning API">
      <t>The following use cases are non-normative examples to illustrate the usage of the User Questioning API by a Client.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="format %d.">
			<t>The Client can be a bank and the User Questioning API is used to challenge the End-User when he wants to pay on Internet in order to secure the transaction.. This is similar to 3D-Secure. The question could be: "Do you allow a payment of XXX euros to XXX?".</t>
			<t>The Client can be a bank and the User Questioning API is used to challenge the End-User when he wants to add a new beneficiary for a bank transfer. The question could be: "Do you allow XXX to be added to your beneficiaries?".</t>
			<t>The Client can be a drive-in food market and the User Questioning API is used to ask the End-User if he accepts the exchange of one missing product by another. The question could be: "Do you agree to get product XXX instead of product XXX?".</t>
			<t>The Client can be a ticketing plateform and the User Questioning API is used to prevent transactions by bots. The question could be: "Do you confirm that you are currently booking a ticket?".</t>
			<t>The Client can be an airline company and the User Questioning API is used to be sure that the End-User is notified of a delay. The question could be: "Your flight is postponed. Can you confirm that you are aware?".</t>

            OpenID Connect Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0
                     draft-mobile-authentication-01

Abstract

   RPs are keen to use high quality authentication methods which can be
   provided by the MNOs.  However a RP must be able to describe its
   demands for an authentication request and it must be able to do this
   interoperable.

   The Mobile Profile will specify how RP's request a certain level of
   assurance for the authentication.  We propose to use the definition
   of Level of Assurance as specified in [6] as a starting point and
   define respective normative ACR values.

   Moreover the profile will specify an encrypted login hint to allow
   for the transport of identifiers to the OP.

   TBD: something about the context parameter

                 OIDC Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0         Oct 2015


1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0 is a profile of the
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] specification that defines
   common authentication contexts to be used across MNO and Mandatory to
   Implement features for MNO to assure interoperability of clients
   across MNO.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the termn "OpenID Provider (OP)" and "Relying
   Party (RP)" as defined by OpenID Connect Core [OpenID.Core].  This
   specification also defines the following terms:

   Mobile Network Operator (MNO)  A provider of wireless communication
      services that owns or controls the wireless network elements
      necessary to sell and deliver services to an end user.

   Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN)  A
      telephone number uniquely identifying a subscription in a mobile
      network.  T

2.  Overview

   This specification serves as a profile based on OpenID Connect Core
   [OpenID.Core].  It defines additional request parameters in the
   Authentication Request.  It also specifies authentication class
   reference values based on the ISO/IEC DIS 29115 [ISO.29115] to be
   used for the acr_values request parameter

3.  Authentication Request

   MODRNA supports all request parameters as specified in OpenID Connect
   Core 3.1.2.1 [OpenID.Core]

   In addtion the following parameters are defined.

                 OIDC Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0         Oct 2015


   acr_values  REQUIRED.  For MODRNA the parameter is REQUIRED to enable
      the Relying Party to indicate a MODRNA conform authentication
      request.  Allowed values are defined in Section 4

   login_hint_token  OPTIONAL.  The login_hint_token is used to
      transport a user identifier from the discovery service to the
      OpenID Provider without revealing this identifier to the client.
      Section 5 specifies the structure of this parameter.

   context  OPTIONAL.  Interlock message to tie the consumption device
      and the authentication device together.  How to ensure that the
      message is actually shown on all relevant devices is out of the
      scope of this document.  Possible values and constraints are
      specified in Section 7

4.  acr_values request values and level of assurance

   The acr_values reflect the level of assurance as specified in ISO
   29115 [ISO.29115].

   A urn is used to be able to register to IANA.

   It is important to note that the acr_values specified in this profile
   are only intended for credential validation.  Identity or claim
   assurance is not included in this specification.

   TBD: Do we have to specify the actual methodologies here?

   urn:modrna:acr:credential:loa1  Litte or no confidence in the
      asserted identifier.  No verification of the posted credentials is
      performed.

   urn:modrna:acr:credential:loa2  Some confidence in the asserted
      identifier.  Single factor authentication is performed.

   urn:modrna:acr:credential:loa3  High confidence in the asserted
      identifier.  Multi-factor authentication shall be used.

   urn:modrna:acr:credential:loa4  Very high confidence in the asserted
      identifier.  The use of tamper-resistant hardware devices for the
      storage of all cryptrographic keys.

5.  login_hint_token

   The login_hint_token is a Json Web Token [JWT] that contains the
   following elements:

                 OIDC Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0         Oct 2015


   iss  REQUIRED.  The party creating the token.  This value MUST be
      used to obtain the JWK file required to validate the tokens's
      signature (see Section 6).

   aud  REQUIRED.  The party to receive the token, typically the users
      OpenID Provider.  The value SHOULD be the issuer URI of the OID as
      exposed in the openid-configuration.

   iat  REQUIRED.  When the token was issued.

   MSISDN  REQUIRED.  NUMERIC The Subscriber identifier TBD: according
      to what standard? - E.123 E.164

   The following is a non-normative example of JWT body (with line wraps
   within values for display purposes only):

     {
      "iss": "https://discovery-provider.com",
      "aud": "https://babytel.com",
      "iat": 1311280970,
      "MSISDN": "5555551212"
       }
     }

6.  login_hint_token encryption and signing

   The login_hint token MUST be encrypted using the public key of the
   OpenID Provider.  The login_hint token MUST be signed using the
   private key of the discovery service.

   TBD: add description on how to process/validate the signature From
   https://bitbucket.org /openid/mobile/issues/13/encrypted-login-hint.
   Standard mechanism is described where? --> John

7.  context

   TBD: in detail description of the allowed content of the context
   parameter.  TBD: Add method of protection of context parameter using
   the OIDC request object

8.  mandatory to implement

   acr_values  All MODRNA compliant OP's MUST accept the in Section 4
      specified acr_values.

   Support for account chooser: push login_hint_token to the account
   chooser TBD: discussion in issue #24

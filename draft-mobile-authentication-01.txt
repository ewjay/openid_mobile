            OpenID Connect Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0
                     draft-mobile-authentication-01

Abstract

   RPs are keen to use high quality authentication methods which can be
   provided by the MNOs.  However a RP must be able to describe its
   demands for an authentication request and it must be able to do this
   interoperable.

   The Mobile Profile will specify how RP's request a certain level of
   assurance for the authentication.  We propose to use the definition
   of Level of Assurance as specified in [6] as a starting point and
   define respective normative ACR values.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0 is a profile of the
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] specification that defines
   common authentication contexts to be used across MNO and Mandatory to
   Implement features for MNO to assure interoperability of clients
   across MNO.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  This
   specification also defines the following terms:

   Token Agent (TA)  A native application that obtains access tokens on
      behalf of other native applications - thereby enabling a Single
      SignOn experience for Native Application end users because the
      End-Users need only explicitly authenticate the _TA_ once per
      Authorization Server.

   AppInfo Endpoint  A protected resource that the _TA_ can call (using
      its primary access token) to obtain metadata corresponding to a
      set of applications - both web & native.  The _TA_ uses the
      application metadata in order to obtain secondary access tokens
      for those applications.

   Primary Token  An OAuth token (access, refresh, and id_token)
      obtained by the _TA_ for its own uses.

   Secondary Token  An OAuth access token obtained by the _TA_ on behalf
      of another native application.

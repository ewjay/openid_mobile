            OpenID Connect Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0
                     draft-mobile-authentication-01

Abstract

   RPs are keen to use high quality authentication methods which can be
   provided by the MNOs.  However a RP must be able to describe its
   demands for an authentication request and it must be able to do this
   interoperable.

   The Mobile Profile will specify how RP's request a certain level of
   assurance for the authentication.  We propose to use the definition
   of Level of Assurance as specified in [6] as a starting point and
   define respective normative ACR values.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0 is a profile of the
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core] specification that defines
   common authentication contexts to be used across MNO and Mandatory to
   Implement features for MNO to assure interoperability of clients
   across MNO.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  This
   specification also defines the following terms:

   Token Agent (TA)  A native application that obtains access tokens on
      behalf of other native applications - thereby enabling a Single
      SignOn experience for Native Application end users because the
      End-Users need only explicitly authenticate the _TA_ once per
      Authorization Server.

   AppInfo Endpoint  A protected resource that the _TA_ can call (using
      its primary access token) to obtain metadata corresponding to a
      set of applications - both web & native.  The _TA_ uses the
      application metadata in order to obtain secondary access tokens
      for those applications.

   Primary Token  An OAuth token (access, refresh, and id_token)
      obtained by the _TA_ for its own uses.

   Secondary Token  An OAuth access token obtained by the _TA_ on behalf
      of another native application.

                 OIDC Mobile Authentication Profile 1.0         Dec 2014


2.  Overview

   Overview.

3.

   JCO: what are the right acr values to reflect either legal
   indentities or pure digital identities?

4.  acr_values request and acr reponse

   JCO: Reiteration of the corresponding values.  Support for al least
   Joe1 (digital identity)

5.  amr

   JCO: the amr response value must be considered in relation to the acr
   repsonse

6.  Processing the login_hint_token

   For specification of login_hint_token look at the discovery part of
   the Mobile Profile section ???

7.  Specifying the truthyness of user claims

   JCO: Something about how the claim was verified (self_asserted,
   proved).  Leads to a structure of claims.

8.  Special claims for Mobile Operators as OpenID Providers

   JCO: special claims

9.  pair wise

10.  mandatory to implement

   SPOP: symmetric proof of possession MANDATORY

   Mandatory support for private_key_jwt, SHOULD basic (section 9 of
   OpenID Connect) --> this implies public key exchange during
   registration.

   mandatory scopes (claims) as a question to the group.

   Support for account chooser: push login_hint_token to the account
   chooser

   asymmetric RSA signing for id_token --> publish jks-uri

   code flow, code id_token etc. optional

   login_hint_token to be implemented per the discovery spec

11.  Security Considerations

   TBD

12.  Privacy Considerations

   JCO: pair wise subject mandatory for Mobile Connect OpenID Provider.
   The RP can negotiate for the exact mechanism.

13.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.

   JCO: Is this true?  Didn't we talk about registering acr_values / acr
   at IANA?

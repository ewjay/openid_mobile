      section 2.1 specifies a way to normalize a user identifier to derive a
      resource and especially a host for OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery.
      While this works well for identifiers as email addresses and urls, it
      does not work for typical identifiers from the mobile network space. In
      a mobile environment, MSISDN's or ip-addresses are typical resources
      identifying a user or the respective mobile network operator (MNO). The
      structure of those identifiers does not allow for an algorithmic
      normalization. Thus it will be necessary to have a specific service to
      perform the normalization.</t>

      <t>The OpenID Connect Mobile Discovery Profile specifies the interface
      of this service. Part of the interface specification will be the
      identification of possible user input identifier types relevant in the
      Mobile Connect scenario. Remark: Some of those user input identifier
      types may not identify a single user/device but may be sufficient to
      identify the right mobile operator. An example for this is the MNC/MCC
      tuple (mobile network code/ mobile contry code) or the IP address
      range.</t>

      <t>This profile also specifies how a client registers with the MNO
      discovery service and how <xref target="Account.Chooser">Account Chooser
      service</xref> can be used to further improve user experience in the
      overall Mobile Connect flow.</t>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>This specification defines two different discovery flows intended to
      fit the needs of both server-based web as well as native applications
      residing on mobile devices.</t>

      <t>The protocol design is guided by to following requirements:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>A user's MSISDN can be used to determine the respective MNO. In
          order to preserve privacy of the user's MSISDN, it is assumed that
          it is typically entered in the user interface provided by the
          trusted discovery service. From a practial perspective, some RPs
          will either already are in posession of MSISDNs or may obtain it
          from the mobile device's operating system (which tyically also
          requires user consent). Therefore this specification will allow RPs
          to pass MSISDNs to the discovery service in general. It is at the
          discretion of the respective discovery service to authorize certain
          RPs to use this feature.</t>

          <t>Due to privacy reasons and the cost risk for MNOs associated with
          it, it must be ensured that the discovery service cannot be abused
          as a mobile phone number lookup service by unauthorized parties.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>OpenID Connect RPs using this specification are encouraged to use the
      <xref target="Account.Chooser">OpenID Account chooser service</xref>.
      This allows them to bypass discovery for users that already have account
      information cached.</t>

      <section title="Redirect-based flow">
        <t>This section gives an overview on the redirect-based flow, which is
        intended to be used by server-side web application. The design of this
        flow is inspired by the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow <xref
        target="RFC6749"/>.</t>

        <t>Note: This flow, in contrast to the POST-based flow, does support
        lookup of the MNO based on the user's MSISDN.</t>

          Flow)</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>(A) The RP first tries to obtain data of a valid user account
            from the Account Chooser Central Data Store in the User's browser.
            If appropriate user accounts can be found in the local storage,
            the user is presented with those user accounts and asked to select
            one of them for use for the authentication process.</t>

            <t>(B) If an user account is selected by the user, the account
            chooser sends the respective Issuer and a pseudonym user id to the
            RP. The RP then skips steps C through F and directly obtains the
            MNO's OPs openid configuration (steps G and H).</t>

            <t>(C) If no appropriate user account could be found, the RP
            starts the issuer discovery by sending a discovery request to the
            User Interaction endpoint of the Mobile Issuer Discovery Service.
            The RP identifies itself by way of an client id and indicates the
            URI the user interaction service shall send the user agent to
            after processing the request. Moreover, the RP may pass MCC/MNC,
            IMSI, or MSISDN as part of the discovery request. If this data is
            available, it is used to determine the MNO. Otherwise or if this
            attempt fails, the user interaction service first tries to deduce
            the MNO from source IP address range of the request. If that's
            impossible, the user is asked for her MSISDN, which is used to
            lookup the respective MNO from a database.</t>

            <t>(D) The User Interaction Endpoint does not directly respond to
            the RP with the Issuer of the MNO's OP. Instead, it creates a
            code, which is associated with the ongoing transaction and sends
            it back to the RP using the redirect URI passed by the RP. This
            indirection allows to authenticate and authorize the RP at the
            Issuer endpoint before the process is completed.</t>

            <t>(E) The RP sends the code along with its credentials to the
            Issuer Endpoint.</t>

            <t>(F) The endpoint validates the client credentials and responds
            with the OpenID Issuer associated with the user's MNO. If the user
            provided the discovery service with her MSISDN in order to
            determine the MNO, this MSISDN is encrypted and also returned to
            the RP. The RP is supposed to pass this encrypted MSISDN as
            additional hint to the authentication process in order to spare
            the user to enter the MSISDN twice.</t>

            <t>(G) The RP builds the URL refering to the OpenID configuration
            of the MNO's OpenID server and sends a GET request to it.</t>

            <t>(H) The OP provides the RP with a JSON document containing meta
            data regarding endpoints, capabilities and policies. The RP is now
            fully equipped to start interaction with the respective OP.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The User Interaction and Issuer Endpoints are specified in sections
        <xref target="ui_endpoint"> </xref> and <xref
        target="discovery_endpoint"/> , respectively.</t>

        <t>Access to the OP's meta data (steps (G) and (H)) is defined in
        <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"/>, section 4, and is therefore outside
        of the scope of this specification.</t>

        <t>Note: After the RP logged the user in sucessfully with a particular
        OP (and has remembered the respective Issuer URL), there is no need to
        conduct the full issuer process again. The RP can instead directly
        obtain the OP's meta data using the openid configuration (steps G and
        H).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="POST-based flow">
        <t>This section gives an overview on the POST-based flow, which is
        intended to be used by native apps residing on mobile devices. The
        rationale is to allow apps to conduct issuer discovery without the
        need to use a web browser, which would degrade user experience and
        increase complexity and implementation effort. The assumption is that
        such apps cannot reliably be authenticated and authorized, so
        MSISDN-based lookup is not offered.</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>(A) In contrast to the web-based flow, the RP typically
            provides data (MNC/MCC,IMSI, or MSISDN) to determine the user's
            MNO to the discovery process. The service tries to determine the
            MNO based on this data. If this data is not present, the discovery
            service attempts to determine the MNO based on the RP's IP
            address. If that fails, the discovery process fails.</t>

            <t>(B) The Issuer Endpoint responds with the OpenID Issuer or an
            error message.</t>

            <t>(C) The RP builds the URL refering to the OpenID configuration
            of the MNO and sends a GET request to it.</t>

        <t>TBD: what if the service cannot determine the MNO? Currently the
        discovery process fails. Alternatively, the discovery service could
        respond to the RP with a list of potential MNOs, which the RP could

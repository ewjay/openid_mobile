 OpenID Connect MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow
                                  1.0
      draft-mobile-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-01

Abstract

   OpenID Connect allows RP's authenticate their users for clients of
   all types, including browser-based JavaScript and native mobile apps,
   to launch sign-in flows and receive verifiable assertions about the
   identity of signed-in users.

   In all of these flows initiated by the RP, the end-user interaction
   from the consumption device is required and, they are based on HTTP
   redirection mechanisms.  However, some use cases not covered for
   these flows, where the RP needs to be the initiator the user
   authentication flow and the end-user interaction from the consumption
   device is not needed have been raised.

   The MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow will
   specify a new authentication flow, by means of which the RP's that
   know the user identifier they want to authenticate (e-mail, msisdn),
   will be able to initiate an interaction flow to authenticate their
   users withouth having end-user interaction from a consumption device.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication
   Flow 1.0 is an authentication flow of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0
   [OpenID.Core] specification intended to allow RP's who already know
   the MSISDN of an end-user to initiate an authentication flow to
   request user authentication from MNO's.  Moreover it defines
   Mandatory to Implement features for MNOs to ensure interoperability
   of clients across MNO's.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the termn "OpenID Provider (OP)" and "Relying
   Party (RP)" as defined by OpenID Connect Core [OpenID.Core].  This
   specification also defines the following terms:

   Mobile Network Operator (MNO)  A provider of wireless communication
      services that owns or controls the wireless network elements
      necessary to sell and deliver services to an end user.

   Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN)  A
      telephone number uniquely identifying a subscription in a mobile
      network.

   Consumption Device (CD)  A user agent, most probably a browser, on
      which the user consumes the actual service provided by the Relying
      Party.

   Authentication Device (AD)  A mobile device on which the user will
      authenticate the actual login.

3.  Overview

   This specification defines a new authentication flow based on
   [OpenID.Core].  It reuses most of the request parameters in the
   Authentication Request, at the same time, it specifies some new
   parameters as well as a new authentication endpoint.

4.  Authorization Backchannel Endpoint

   The Backchannel Authorization Endpoint performs Authentication of the
   End-User.  This is done by sending an HTTP POST message directly from
   the Relay Party to the Authorization Server's Backchannel
   Authorization Endpoint, using request parameters defined by OAuth 2.0
   and additional parameters and parameter values defined by OpenID
   Connect.  Communication with the Authorization Endpoint MUST utilize
   TLS.  See Section 16.17 [OpenID.Core]for more information on using
   TLS.

5.  Authentication Request

   An Authentication Request is an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] Authorization
   Request that requests that the End-User be authenticated by the
   Authorization Server.

   MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication defines an
   authentication request that is requested directly from the client to
   the MNO without going through the user's browser.  The client MUST
   send an authentication request to the OpenID provider (MNO) by
   building an "HTTP POST" request that will take to the MNO all the
   information needed to authenticate the user without asking her for
   their MSISDN.

   The client MUST authenticate to the Backchannel Authorization
   Endpoint using the authentication method registered for its
   client_id, as described in Section 9 on [OpenID.Core].

   Authentication Requests are made using the MODRNA profile.  Only the
   following parameters are taking in consideration in the Client
   initiated Backchannel Authentication flow.  The rest of the request
   parameters defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] MUST be ignored by the
   Authorization Server.

   scope  REQUIRED.  OpenID Connect implements authentication as an
      extension to the OAuth 2.0 by including the openid scope value in
      the Authorization Request.

    OIDC MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication FlowA1.02016


   client_req_id  REQUIRED.  It is a unique id provided by the RP that
      will be used by the Identity Provider as a beared token to
      authenticate the callback request to send the tokens to the RP.

   client_notification_endpoint  OPTIONAL.  Callback URI to which the
      response will be sent.  This URI MUST exactly match one of the
      "Client initiated Backchannel Authentication" callback URI values
      for the Client pre-registered at the OpenID Provider, with the
      matching performed as described in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986]
      (Simple String Comparison).  When using this flow, the Callback
      URI SHOULD use the https scheme.

      At the time of registering in Mobile Connect, the RP must provide
      the information about whether receiving the token response through
      a callback to the "client_notification_endpoint" or through a
      polling mechanism where the RP MUST polls the authorization server
      repeatedly as defined in Successful Authentication Response
      (Section 7) until the end-user completes the approval process.

   acr_values  REQUIRED.  As defined in MODRNA Authentication profile.

   login_hint_token  OPTIONAL.  As defined in MODRNA Authentication
      profile.

   id_token_hint  OPTIONAL.  As defined in Section 3.1.2.1 on
      [OpenID.Core].

   login_hint  OPTIONAL.  As defined in Section 3.1.2.1 on
      [OpenID.Core].

   context  REQUIRED.  This parameter provides a context in the Mobile
      Connect request that clearly identifies the action/transaction
      that the user is being asked to authorise.

   As the Client initiated Backchannel Authentication flow does not have
   an interaction with the end-user through a consumption device, it is
   REQUIRED that the RP provides one (and only one) of the hints
   specified above in the authentication request, that is
   "login_hint_token", "id_token_hint" or "login_hint".

   The following is a non-normative example from an authentication
   request (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

            POST /bc-authorize HTTP/1.1
            Host: server.example.com
            Content-Type: application/json
            {
             "scope": "openid",
             "client_req_id": "8d67dc78-7faa-4d41-aabd-67707b374255",
             "client_notification_endpoint": "https://client.example.com/cb",

                XFBoMYUZodetZdvTiFvSkQ"
            }


6.  Authentication Request Validation

   The Authorization Server MUST validate the request received as
   follows:

   1.  Authenticate the Client if it was issued Client Credentials or if
       it uses another Client Authentication method, as described in
       Section 9 on [OpenID.Core].

   2.  The Authorization Server MUST validate all the OAuth 2.0
       parameters according to the MODRNA specification.

   3.  In the event of a request contains more than one of this hints
       specified in Authentication Request (Section 5), the Identity
       provider MUST return an "invalid_request" error response as per
       Section 3.1.2.6 on [OpenID.Core].

   4.  If the authentication request contains a
       "client_notification_endpoint" when it has not been provided at
       the registering time or viceversa, it is contained when it has
       not been provided, the Identity Provider MUST return an
       "invalid_request" error response, per Section 3.1.2.6 on
       [OpenID.Core].

    OIDC MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication FlowA1.02016


   5.  If the "client_notification_endpoint" parameter is present, it
       MUST exactly match one of the callback URI values for the Client
       pre-registered at the OpenID Provider, with the matching
       performed as described in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986] (Simple
       String Comparison).

   6.  NOTE: the callback URI values registered for the
       "client_notification_endpoint" are different than those
       registered for the redirect_uri in the Authorization Code flow.

   7.  The Authorization Server MUST verify that all the REQUIRED
       parameters are present and their usage conforms to this
       specification.

   As specified in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], Authorization Servers SHOULD
   ignore unrecognized request parameters.

   If the Authorization Server encounters any error, it MUST return an
   error response, per Section 3.1.2.6 on [OpenID.Core].

7.  Successful Authentication Request Acknowdlegment

   If the Authentication Validation Request is OK, the Authorization
   Server will return an HTTP 200 OK response to the RP to indicate that
   the authentication request has been accepted and it is going to be
   processed.  The body of this response will contain:

   auth_req_id  REQUIRED.  It is a unique id to identify the
      authentication request (transaction) made by the RP.  The
      "auth_req_id" will be sent too in the token through the
      "client_notification_endpoint" to allow the RP to correlate the
      authentication request and the received tokens.

   expires in  REQUIRED.  Expiration time of the Authentication in
      seconds since the auth_request was received.

   interval  OPTIONAL.  The minimum amount of time in seconds that the
      client SHOULD wait between polling requests to the token endpoint.
      This parameter will only be present in case of the authentication
      request doesn't take the "client_notification_endpoint" parameter
      or there are not any callback URI registered as
      "client_notification_endpoint" for the RP.

   If the Authentication Validation Request is NOK, the Authorization
   Server MUST return an error response, per Section 3.1.2.6.

   The following is a non-normative example from an authentication
   response

               HTTP/1.1 200 OK
               Content-Type: application/json
               Cache-Control: no-store
               Pragma: no-cache
               {
                 "auth_req_id": "1c266114-a1be-4252-8ad1-04986c5b9ac1",
                 "expires_in": 3600,
                 "interval": 2
               }


8.  Authentication Request Acknowdlegment Validation

   If the client (RP) receives an HTTP 200 OK, it MUST validate that all
   the required parameters are received.  The RP should keep the
   authentication request identifier "auth_req_id" and the expiration
   time in order to match it with token response.

   The client will have to keep the expiration time as well to be able
   to discard the authentication request acknowdlegment.

9.  Authorization Server Obtains End-user Consent/Authorization

   Once the End-User is authenticated, the Authorization Server MUST
   obtain an authorization decision before releasing information to the
   Relying Party.  When using the Client initiated Backchannel
   Authentication flow, there is not any interactive dialogue between
   the Authorization Server and the end-user through the consumption
   device, so the consent establishing only can take place via the
   authentication device or by establishing consent via conditions for
   processing the request or other means (for example, via previous
   administrative consent).  Sections 2 and 5.3 of [OpenID.Core]
   describe information release mechanisms.

   NOTE: the current version of the Client initiated Backchannel
   Authentication Flow spec. does not specify any mechanism to use the
   authentication device to obtain the end-user consent.

10.  Token Request Using Polling Mechanism

   When the authentication request doesn't include the
   "client_notification_endpoint" parameter or there are not any
   callback URI registered for this notification endpoint for this RP in
   the Identity Provider, the client must polls the token endpoint until
   the end-user grants or denies the request.

    OIDC MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication FlowA1.02016


   The client polls at reasonable interval which MUST NOT exceed the
   minimum interval provided by the authorization server via the
   "interval" parameter (if provided).

   The client makes a "POST" request to the token endpoint by sending
   the following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded" format with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type  REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to
      "urn:openid:params:modrna:grant-type:backchannel_request".

   auth_req_id  REQUIRED.  It is a unique id to identify the
      authentication request (transaction) made by the RP.  The
      "auth_req_id" will be sent too in the authentication response to
      allow the RP to correlate the authentication request and the
      received tokens (id_token and access_token).

   The following is a non-normative example of a token request (with
   line wraps within values for display purposes only).

              POST /token HTTP/1.1
              Host: server.example.com
              Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
              Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
              {
                grant_type="urn:openid:params:modrna:grant-type:backchannel_request"
                &amp;auth_req_id=40582304823
              }


11.  Token Response

   If the "client_notification_endpoint" is not present the
   Authorization Server will return the token as an HTTP response to the
   RP's poll request.  If the user is well authenticated, the
   Authorization Server will returns a succesful response that includes
   an ID Token and an Access Token.  Otherwise it responses with an
   error as defined in Token Error Response (Section 12).

              }


12.  Token Error Response

   If the Token Request is invalid or unauthorized, the Authorization
   Server constructs the error response according to the section 3.1.3.4
   Token Error Response of [OpenID.Core].  In addition to the error
   codes defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749], the following error codes
   are specific for the Client Initiated Backchannel flow:

   authorization_pending  The authorization request is still pending as
      the end-user hasn't yet been authenticated.

   slow_down  The client is polling too quickly and should back off at a
      reasonable rate.

13.  Issuing Successfull Token

   When the authentication request includes a
   "client_notification_endpoint", the Authorization Server will send
   the token response making a "POST HTTP Request" to the RP's
   client_notification_endpoint.  If the user is well authenticated, the
   Authorization Server returns a successful response that includes an

    OIDC MODRNA Client initiated Backchannel Authentication FlowA1.02016


   ID Token and an Access Token.  If the request failed client
   authentication or is invalid, the authorization server returns an
   error response as described in Issuing Token Error (Section 14).

   All the parameters in the successful response are defined in
   Section 4.1.4 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] except the new one "auth_req_id"
   that will be the same received in the request as defined in
   Successful Authentication Response (Section 7).  The response uses
   the application/json media type.

   The following is a non-normative example of a token response sending
   as a HTTP POST request to the callback uri specified in the

              OpenID Connect Mobile Discovery Profile 1.0
                       draft-mobile-discovery-01

Abstract

   OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] section 2.1 specifies
   a way to normalize a user identifier to derive a resource and
   especially a host for OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery.  While this
   works well for identifiers as email addresses and urls it does not
   work for MNO identifiers.  In a mobile environment, MSISDN's or ip-
   addresses are typical resources identifying a user.  The structure of
   those identifiers does not allow for an algorithmic normalization.
   Thus it will be necessary to have a specific service to perform the
   normalization.

   The Mobile Profile will specify the interface of this service.  Part
   of the interface specification will be the identification of possible
   user input identifier types relevant in the Mobile Connect scenario.
   Remark: Some of those user input identifier types may not identify a
   single user/device but may be sufficient to identify the right mobile
   operator.  An example for this is the MNC/MCC tuple (mobile network
   code/ mobile contry code) or the IP address range.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Mobile Discovery Profile 1.0 is a profile of the
   OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] specification that
   stipulates how a OpenID Connect client can use MNO identifiers to
   determine the authoritative issuer for a identifier thereby enabling
   a Single SignOn experience for End-Users.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  This
   specification also defines the following terms:

   Token Agent (TA)  A native application that obtains access tokens on
      behalf of other native applications - thereby enabling a Single
      SignOn experience for Native Application end users because the
      End-Users need only explicitly authenticate the _TA_ once per
      Authorization Server.

   AppInfo Endpoint  A protected resource that the _TA_ can call (using
      its primary access token) to obtain metadata corresponding to a
      set of applications - both web & native.  The _TA_ uses the
      application metadata in order to obtain secondary access tokens
      for those applications.

   Primary Token  An OAuth token (access, refresh, and id_token)
      obtained by the _TA_ for its own uses.

   Secondary Token  An OAuth access token obtained by the _TA_ on behalf
      of another native application.

2.  Overview

   Overview.

   OpenID Connect Clients using this specification are encouraged to use
   the OpenID Account chooser service.  This allows them to bypass
   discovery for users that already have account information cached.

3.  User Discovery Service

3.1.  Registration

   The client must register with the discovery service and have a valid
   OAuth client_id.

3.2.  Request

   The client creates a authorization request using the OAuth scope
   "providerid"

3.3.  Response

   The Authorization server returns a code or token depending on the
   requested response type.

3.4.  Error Response

3.5.  Discovery endpoint Response

   The response from the Discovery endpoint is a JSON object containing
   the following top level elements:

   user_iss  The Issuer URI "iss" for the user who has authorized
      discovery.

   user_hint_token  A Encrypted JSON web token (JWE) that contains the
      user hint for the issuer.  The token is encrypted with the public
      key of the issuer.  This is passed to the issuer in the
      authentication request.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD

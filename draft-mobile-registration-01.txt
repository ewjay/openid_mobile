             OpenID Connect Mobile Registration Profile 1.0
                      draft-mobile-registration-01

Abstract

   The profile shall allow a RP to access ID services of multiple MNOs
   (e.g. in a market) while not requiring this RP to (manually) register
   with all of them.  The RP shall register to a certain MNO or another
   entity MNOs delegated this task to once and obtain the right to
   access the desired MNO's ID services.  To enable this autonomy of
   relying parties and OpenID Providers (the MNO's) dynamic client
   registration must be possible.  It is however necessary to verify the
   level of trustworthiness (and potentially entitlement) of an RP and
   enable the OP to approve or block RP's accordingly.  Thus it will be
   necessary to establish some measures of control to verify the
   legitimacy of the RP.

   For the Mobile Profile we propose to extend [4] with Software
   Statements as specified in [5].

   It is beyond the scope of the Mobile Profile how the RP will obtain
   original legitimation.  It is assumed that some trustworthy party
   validates the RP and issues the software statement to the RP.

   It is also beyond the scope of the Mobile Profile how an OP validates
   the software statement.

   It could be in scope to profile the use of software statements to (a)
   certain signature algorithm(s) and meta data.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect Mobile Registration Profile 1.0 is a profile of the
   OpenID Connect Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration] specification
   that allows a Client to dynamically register with multiple Mobile 
   Network Operators (MNOs) based on information asserted by a primary 
   MNO that the client has a relationship with.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Refresh Token",
   "Authorization Code", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
   "Authorization Endpoint", "Client", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Protected Resource", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server",
   and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  This
   specification also defines the following terms:

   Token Agent (TA)  A native application that obtains access tokens on
      behalf of other native applications - thereby enabling a Single
      SignOn experience for Native Application end users because the
      End-Users need only explicitly authenticate the _TA_ once per
      Authorization Server.

   AppInfo Endpoint  A protected resource that the _TA_ can call (using
      its primary access token) to obtain metadata corresponding to a
      set of applications - both web & native.  The _TA_ uses the
      application metadata in order to obtain secondary access tokens
      for those applications.

   Primary Token  An OAuth token (access, refresh, and id_token)
      obtained by the _TA_ for its own uses.

   Secondary Token  An OAuth access token obtained by the _TA_ on behalf
      of another native application.

                  OIDC Mobile Registration Profile 1.0      October 2014


2.  Overview

   The OIDC Mobile Profile is based on OpenID Connect 1.0 intended to 
   be appropriate for use by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) providing
   identity services to Relaying Parties (RPs).
   
   This specification defines the dynamic client registration process
   for OIDC Mobile Profile and describes how an OpenID Connect Relying
   Party can dynamically register with the End-User's Mobile Network
   Operator and obtain the information needed to use it with multiple 
   MNOs.

3.  Client Registration

3.1 Registration

3.2	Software Statement

	TBD

3.3	Error Response

	[Editor's note:] Error message should include the scenario when an OP blocks a RP.

4.  Security Considerations

	[Editor's note:] Define authentication mechanism. Start with RSA and define minimum and maximum key length.  

5.  Privacy Considerations

   TBD

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.
